# Write a program that produces a bar chart showing the population growth of Prairieville, a small town in the Midwest, at 20-year intervals during the past 100 years. 
# The program should read in the population figures for 1900, 1920, 1940, 1960, 1980, and 2000 from a file named People.txt.
# It is understood that the first value represents the population in 1900 (for example, 2,843), the second the population in 1920 and so on. 
# For each year it should display the year, followed by at least one space followed by a bar consisting of one asterisk for each 1,000 people.
